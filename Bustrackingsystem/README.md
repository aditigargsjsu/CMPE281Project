Mobile Transportation Sensing Services The objective of our project is to implement a mobile sensing Infrastructure-as-a-Service (MS-IaaS), which could provide mobile sensor resources to multiple users on demand. In a MS-IaaS, mobile sensor clusters, computing, storage and network resources are provided in a pay-as-you-use business model. The key objective of our MS-IaaS solution is to provide an infrastructure for users to build user-designed and user-customized mobile sensor services and applications.
